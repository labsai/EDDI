## Why choose E.D.D.I over other technologies

### We have asked that question to our users and here are some reasons they mentioned

* it is open source ðŸ’š
* the configuration is very open and flexible
* the code is self-explanatory and easy to extend
*   eddi is channel independent, therefore can be used anywhere
*   the \(NLP\) parser is extremely cool
*   the framework is focused and does not pretend to be the magic bullet that solves it all
*   great tech stack, when you want to build a chatbot product yourself

## Intro

The Chatbot System - E.D.D.I \(Enhanced Dialog Driven Intelligence\), has been developed with the focus on the use in enterprise applications as well as the ease of connecting it to other resources \(such as databases or other Services\).

This platform has been developed for over many years and completely restructured from scratch four times because of logical "dead ends" in the art of building chatbots - thus version 4.

The most outstanding features are:

*   Flexible in NLP and Behavior
*   Fluently connect to REST APIs
*   Powerful Templating
*   Reuse Conversation Flows in multiple bots

technical spec:

*   Resource- / REST-oriented architecture
*   OAuth 2.0 / Basic Authentication
*   Java
*   JAX-RS
*   Dependency Injection
*   Embedded Jetty
*   NoSQL
*   HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON

## Prerequirements

* Java 11
* Maven 3
* MongoDB >4.0

## Build project with maven

Go to the root directory and execute

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Start Servers

1. Setup a local mongodb \(&gt; v4.0\)
2. launch with VM options

   ```text
    -DEDDI_ENV=[development/production] -Duser.dir=[LOCAL_PATH_TO_EDDI]\apiserver ai.labs.api.ApiServer
   ```

3. Go to Browser --&gt; [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070)

Note: If running locally inside an IDE you need _lombok_ to be enabled \(otherwise you will get compile errors complaining about missing constructors\). Either download as plugin \(e.g. inside Intellij\) or follow instructions here [https://projectlombok.org/](https://projectlombok.org/)

## Docker

For development, use

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

after running `mvn package`. This builds a local image of EDDI.

For integration testing run

```bash
./integration-tests.sh
```

or

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml -f docker-compose.testing.yml -p ci up -d
```
