## How to Read This Document

Each entry follows this format:

- **Date** — What changed and why
- **Repo** — Which repository was modified
- **Decision** — Key design decisions and their reasoning
- **Files** — Links to modified files

## Planning Phase (2026-03-05)

### Audit Completed — Implementation Plan Finalized

**Repos involved:** All 5 (EDDI, EDDI-Manager, eddi-chat-ui, eddi-website, EDDI-integration-tests)

**Key decisions made:**

| #   | Decision                                                   | Reasoning                                                                                | Appendix |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | UI framework: **React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**  | AI-friendly (components are plain files), no dependency rot, accessible (Radix), fast DX | J.1a     |
| 2   | Keep Chat UI **standalone** + extract **shared component** | EDDI has a dedicated single-bot chat endpoint; standalone deployment is needed           | M.1      |
| 3   | Website: **Astro** on GitHub Pages                         | Static output, built-in i18n routing, zero JS by default, Tailwind integration           | L        |
| 4   | **Skip API versioning**                                    | Only clients are Manager + Chat UI, both first-party controlled                          | M.7      |
| 5   | **Remove internal snapshot tests**                         | Never production-ready; integration tests provide sufficient coverage                    | K.1      |
| 6   | **Trunk-based branching**                                  | Short-lived feature branches, squash merge, clean main history                           | N.1      |
| 7   | **Mobile-first responsive** is Phase 1                     | Core requirement, not afterthought; Tailwind breakpoints make this natural               | J.4      |

**Biggest gap discovered:** No CI/CD anywhere — all builds, tests, and deployments are manual.

**Strongest existing areas:** Security (SSRF, rate limiting, cost tracking), Monitoring (30+ Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboard), Documentation (40 markdown files published via docs.labs.ai).

## Decision Log

_For recording decisions that come up during implementation that aren't in the plan._

| Date       | Decision                                                              | Context                               | Alternative Considered                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-03-05 | Use Astro (not Expo) for website                                      | Static site on GitHub Pages           | Expo would add unnecessary abstraction for a marketing site |
| 2026-03-05 | Use AI complexity scale (🟢/🟡/🔴/⚫) instead of human time estimates | AI will do all implementation work    | Human hours are meaningless for AI execution                |
| 2026-03-05 | Docs already published at docs.labs.ai                                | Third-party tool reads `docs/` folder | Could migrate to Astro Content Collections later            |
|            |                                                                       |                                       |                                                             |
